	abstract = {A self-consistent scheme for the calculations of the interacting ground state and the near band-gap optical spectra of mono- and multilayer transition-metal-dichalcogenide systems is presented. The approach combines a dielectric model for the Coulomb interaction potential in a multilayer environment, gap equations for the renormalized ground state, and the Dirac-Wannier equation to determine the excitonic properties. To account for the extension of the individual monolayers perpendicular to their basic plane, an effective thickness parameter in the Coulomb interaction potential is introduced. Numerical evaluations show that the resulting finite thickness effects lead to significant modifications in the optical spectra, reproducing the experimentally observed nonhydrogenic features of the excitonic resonance series. Applying the theory for a variety of experimentally relevant configurations, a consistent description of the near band-gap optical properties is obtained all the way from monolayer to bulk. In addition to the well-known in-plane excitons, also interlayer excitons occur in multilayer systems suggesting a reinterpretation of experimental results obtained for bulk material.},

	abstract = {When electron-hole pairs are excited in a semiconductor, it is a priori not clear if they form a plasma of unbound fermionic particles or a gas of composite bosons called excitons. Usually, the exciton phase is associated with low temperatures. In atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, excitons are particularly important even at room temperature due to strong Coulomb interaction and a large exciton density of states. Using state-of-the-art many-body theory, we show that the thermodynamic fission–fusion balance of excitons and electron-hole plasma can be efficiently tuned via the dielectric environment as well as charge carrier doping. We propose the observation of these effects by studying exciton satellites in photoemission and tunneling spectroscopy, which present direct solid-state counterparts of high-energy collider experiments on the induced fission of composite particles.},

	abstract = {An ab initio based fully microscopic many-body approach is used to study the carrier relaxation dynamics in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides. Bandstructures and wavefunctions as well as phonon energies and coupling matrix elements are calculated using density functional theory. The resulting dipole and Coulomb matrix elements are implemented in the Dirac–Bloch equations to calculate carrier–carrier and carrier–phonon scatterings throughout the whole Brillouin zone (BZ). It is shown that carrier scatterings lead to a relaxation into hot quasi-Fermi distributions on a single femtosecond timescale. Carrier cool down and inter-valley transitions are mediated by phonon scatterings on a picosecond timescale. Strong, density-dependent energy renormalizations are shown to be valley-dependent. For MoTe2, MoSe2 and MoS2 the change of energies with occupation is found to be about 50\% stronger in the Σ and Λ side valleys than in the K and K valleys. However, for realistic carrier densities, the materials always maintain their direct bandgap at the K points of the BZ.},

These can be van der Waals structures or heterostructures of organic (polymeric) semiconductors as well as inorganic substances like transition metal dichalcogenides. We consider 2D screened hydrogenic problem with Rytova–Keldysh interaction by means of so-called fractional Scrödinger equation. Our main finding is that above synergy between screening and disorder either destroys the exciton (strong screening) or promote the creation of a bound state, leading to its collapse in the extreme case. Our second finding is energy levels crossing, i.e. the degeneracy (with respect to index \$\${\textbackslash}mu \$\$) of the exciton eigenenergies at certain discrete value of screening radius. Latter effects may also be related to the quantum manifestations of chaotic exciton behavior in above 2D semiconductor structures. Hence, they should be considered in device applications, where the interplay between dielectric screening and disorder is important.},

	abstract = {We present a three-band tight-binding (TB) model for describing the low-energy physics in monolayers of group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se, Te). As the conduction- and valence-band edges are predominantly contributed by the dz2, dxy, and dx2−y2 orbitals of M atoms, the TB model is constructed using these three orbitals based on the symmetries of the monolayers. Parameters of the TB model are fitted from the first-principles energy bands for all MX2 monolayers. The TB model involving only the nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings is sufficient to capture the band-edge properties in the ±K valleys, including the energy dispersions as well as the Berry curvatures. The TB model involving up to the third-nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings can well reproduce the energy bands in the entire Brillouin zone. Spin-orbit coupling in valence bands is well accounted for by including the on-site spin-orbit interactions of M atoms. The conduction band also exhibits a small valley-dependent spin splitting which has an overall sign difference between MoX2 and WX2. We discuss the origins of these corrections to the three-band model. The three-band TB model developed here is efficient to account for low-energy physics in MX2 monolayers, and its simplicity can be particularly useful in the study of many-body physics and physics of edge states.},

Combining fresh treatments of classic problems with up-to-date research, asymptotic techniques appropriate for nonlinear dynamical systems are shown to offer a powerful alternative to numerical simulations. The combined analytical and experimental description of dynamical instabilities provides a clear derivation of physical formulae and an evaluation of their significance. Starting with the observation of different time scales of an operating laser, the book develops approximation techniques to systematically explore their effects. Laser dynamical regimes are introduced at different levels of complexity, from standard turn-on experiments to stiff, chaotic, spontaneous or driven pulsations. Particular attention is given to quantitative comparisons between experiments and theory. The book broadens the range of analytical tools available to laser physicists and provides applied mathematicians with problems of practical interest, making it invaluable for graduate students and researchers.},

After 2010, the mid-infrared optical parametric amplifier became the mainstream driving source. The shortest pulse width of an IAP has reached {\textasciitilde}50 as, an intensity over a gigawatt has been achieved, and the photon energy has been extended to 500 eV. However, owing to the low flux of IAPs, the use of IAPs is still limited in terms of applications. Here we focus on the vigorous efforts in the past decade to extend the performance of IAPs.},

	abstract = {Attosecond technology is a radical departure from all the optical (and collision) technology that preceded it. It merges optical and collision physics. The technology opens important problems in each area of science for study by previously unavailable methods. Underlying attosecond technology is a strong laser field. It extracts an electron from an atom or molecule near the crest of the field. The electron is pulled away from its parent ion, but is driven back after the field reverses. It can then recollide with its parent ion. Since the recolliding electron has a wavelength of about 1 Å, we can measure Angstrom spatial dimensions. Since the strong time-dependent field of the light pulse directs the electron with subcycle precision, we can control and measure attosecond phenomena.

	abstract = {Based on the multiband semiconductor Bloch equations a microscopic approach to high-harmonic generation in crystalline solids which is able to properly describe degenerate bands and band crossings is presented and analyzed. It is well known that numerical band structure calculations typically provide electronic wave functions with an undetermined k-dependent phase which results in matrix elements which contain arbitrary k-dependent phases. In addition, such approaches usually mix degenerate bands and bands with an energy difference smaller than the numerical precision in an arbitrary way for each point in k space. These ambiguities are problematic if one considers the dynamics induced by electric fields since the matrix elements of the position operator involve a derivative of the wave functions with respect to k. When the light-matter interaction is described in the length gauge, the problem of arbitrary phases and degenerate subspace mixing of Bloch states is solved by adopting a smooth gauge transformation along the field direction. The results obtained within this method are validated by comparing with calculations in the velocity gauge. Although we obtain in both gauges the same overall result, the length gauge is advantageous since it converges with a smaller number of bands and thus requires significantly less numerical effort than the velocity gauge. Also a unique distinction between inter- and intraband contributions and thus an instructive physical interpretation is possible in the length gauge whereas in the velocity gauge this is unclear. The computed polarization-direction-dependent high-harmonic spectra agree well with experimental data reported for GaAs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, under proper conditions, the Berry curvature is largely responsible for the even-order harmonics which are polarized perpendicular to the driving field.},

In the present work, we calculate the solar-generated shift current and efficiencies in 326 different 2D materials obtained from the computational database C2DB. We apply, as metrics, the efficiencies of monolayer and multilayer samples. The monolayer efficiencies are generally found to be low, while the multilayer efficiencies of infinite stacks show great promise. Furthermore, the out-of-plane shift current response is considered, and material candidates for efficient out-of-plane shift current devices are identified. Among the screened materials, MXY Janus and MX2 transition metal dichalchogenides (TMDs) constitute a prominent subset, with chromium based MXY Janus TMDs holding particular promise. Finally, in order to explain the band gap dependence of the PV efficiency, a simple gapped graphene model with a variable band gap is established and related to the calculated efficiencies.},

Due to the band gaps of valley and responding differently to off-resonant light together with the huge spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in WSe2, the perfect valley and spin polarizations are obtained. Interestingly, under the effect of electrostatic potential , the valley polarization can be realized even for a tiny light intensity. Additionally, the FM exchange field can assist significantly the spin polarization in a wider region of light intensity and barrier height plane due to the large shift of spin-up and down bands. More important in our results, the highest valley and spin conductance is near 100\% even under the polarized situation. These results demonstrate that WSe2 is a distinguished 2D material for novel spintronics and valleytronics in future.},

A two-dimensional bandstructure model is utilized that allows for the realistic inclusion of Coulomb correlations. It is shown that for off-resonant mid-IR excitation Coulomb correlations lead to a dramatic enhancement of HHG intensity by up to two orders of magnitude. For resonant excitation near the fundamental excitonic resonance the Coulomb interaction leads to dressed harmonics. These have a sub-floor of broad spectral contributions. The amplitude of these contributions is about four to six orders of magnitude below the peak. The width scales linearly with the exciting field and can reach hundreds of meV.},

            Atomically thin group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as a new class of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with extraordinary properties including the direct band gap in the visible frequency range, the pronounced spin–orbit coupling, the ultra-strong Coulomb interaction, and the rich physics associated with the valley degree of freedom. These 2D TMDs exhibit great potential for device applications and have attracted vast interest for the exploration of new physics. 2D TMDs have complex electronic structures which underlie their physical properties. Here we review the bulk electronic structures of these new 2D materials as well as the theoretical models developed at different levels, along which we sort out the understanding of the origins of a variety of properties observed or predicted.},

With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly. The freestanding monolayer exhibits an increase in luminescence quantum efficiency by more than a factor of 104 compared with the bulk material.},

Using strain-gradient engineering, the flexo-photovoltaic effect, that is, the strain-gradient-induced bulk photovoltaic effect, can be activated in centrosymmetric semiconductors, considerably expanding material choices for future sensing and energy applications. Here we report an experimental demonstration of the flexo-photovoltaic effect in an archetypal two-dimensional material, MoS2, by using a strain-gradient engineering approach based on the structural inhomogeneity and phase transition of a hybrid system consisting of MoS2 and VO2. The experimental bulk photovoltaic coefficient in MoS2 is orders of magnitude higher than that in most non-centrosymmetric materials. Our findings unveil the fundamental relation between the flexo-photovoltaic effect and a strain gradient in low-dimensional materials, which could potentially inspire the exploration of new optoelectronic phenomena in strain-gradient-engineered materials.},

There is also a valley dependent Berry phase effect that can result in a valley contrasting Hall transport, with carriers in different valleys turning into opposite directions transverse to an in-plane electric field.

In materials where band edges occur at noncentral valleys, this enables valley-dependent interplay of electrons with light of different circular polarizations, in analogy to spin dependent optical activities in semiconductors. This discovery is in perfect harmony with the previous finding of valley contrasted Bloch band features of orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvatures from inversion symmetry breaking [D. Xiao, W. Yao, and Q. Niu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 236809 (2007)]. A universal connection is revealed between the 𝑘-resolved optical oscillator strength of interband transitions, the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvatures, which also provides a principle for optical measurement of orbital magnetization and intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in ferromagnetic systems. The general physics is demonstrated in graphene where inversion symmetry breaking leads to valley contrasted optical selection rule for interband transitions. We discuss graphene based valley optoelectronics applications where light polarization information can be interconverted with electronic information.},

	abstract = {Quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980's. In the last twenty years, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED enables the study of hybrid quantum systems interacting with microwave photons. Here, we review the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focussing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system. We discuss coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, we discuss important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a new method, based on Feynman-like diagrams, for computing the effective Hamiltonian of driven nonlinear oscillators. The pictorial structure associated with each diagram corresponds directly to a Hamiltonian term, the prefactor of which involves a simple counting of topologically equivalent diagrams. We also leverage the algorithmic simplicity of our scheme in a readily available computer program that generates the effective Hamiltonian to arbitrary order. At the heart of our diagrammatic method is a novel canonical perturbation expansion developed in phase space to capture the quantum nonlinear dynamics. A merit of this expansion is that it reduces to classical harmonic balance in the limit of \${\textbackslash}hbar{\textbackslash}rightarrow0\$. Our method establishes the foundation of the dynamic control of quantum systems with the precision needed for future quantum machines. We demonstrate its value by treating five examples from the field of superconducting circuits. These examples involve an experimental proposal for the Hamiltonian stabilization of a three-legged Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger cat, modeling of energy renormalization phenomena in superconducting circuits experiments, a comprehensive characterization of multiphoton resonances in a driven transmon, a proposal for an novel inductively shunted transmon circuit, and a characterization of classical ultra-subharmonic bifurcation in driven oscillators. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of our method by comparing it with experimental data and exact Floquet numerical diagonalization.},

However, superconducting qubits coupled to a meandering transmission line, or to surface acoustic waves, can realize “giant artificial atoms” that couple to a bosonic field at several points which are wavelengths apart. Here, we study setups with multiple giant atoms coupled at multiple points to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. We show that the giant atoms can be protected from decohering through the waveguide, but still have exchange interactions mediated by the waveguide. Unlike in decoherence-free subspaces, here the entire multiatom Hilbert space (2𝑁 states for 𝑁 atoms) is protected from decoherence. This is not possible with “small” atoms. We further show how this decoherence-free interaction can be designed in setups with multiple atoms to implement, e.g., a 1D chain of atoms with nearest-neighbor couplings or a collection of atoms with all-to-all connectivity. This may have important applications in quantum simulation and quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Superconducting electrical circuits can be used to study the physics of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) in new regimes, therefore realizing circuit QED. For quantum information processing and quantum optics, an interesting regime of circuit QED is the dispersive regime, where the detuning between the qubit transition frequency and the resonator frequency is much larger than the interaction strength. In this paper, we investigate how non-linear corrections to the dispersive regime affect the measurement process. We find that in the presence of pure qubit dephasing, photon population of the resonator used for the measurement of the qubit act as an effective heat bath, inducing incoherent relaxation and excitation of the qubit. Measurement thus induces both dephasing and mixing of the qubit, something that can reduce the quantum non-demolition aspect of the readout. Using quantum trajectory theory, we show that this heat bath can induce quantum jumps in the qubit state and reduce the achievable signal-to-noise ratio of a homodyne measurement of the voltage.},

The measured exciton optical-absorption spectra are used to obtain experimental estimates for the exciton radii that fall in the 7–10Å range and agree well with theory. The measured trion optical-absorption spectra are used to obtain values for the trion radii that also agree well with theory.

The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.},

	abstract = {The electronic structure of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors can be significantly altered by screening effects, either from free charge carriers in the material or by environmental screening from the surrounding medium. The physical properties of 2D semiconductors placed in a heterostructure with other 2D materials are therefore governed by a complex interplay of both intra- and interlayer interactions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission, we are able to isolate both the layer-resolved band structure and, more importantly, the transient band structure evolution of a model 2D heterostructure formed of a single layer of MoS2 on graphene. Our results reveal a pronounced renormalization of the quasiparticle gap of the MoS2 layer. Following optical excitation, the band gap is reduced by up to ∼400 meV on femtosecond time scales due to a persistence of strong electronic interactions despite the environmental screening by the n-doped graphene. This points to a large degree of tunability of both the electronic structure and the electron dynamics for 2D semiconductors embedded in a van der Waals-bonded heterostructure.},

This splits off a pair of hybridized 𝑑 bands which are half-filled in 2⁢𝐻−Ta⁢S2 and 2⁢𝐻−Nb⁢Se2 and completely filled in 2⁢𝐻−Mo⁢S2. As a result of this hybridization gap, the valence or conduction bandwidths in each of these 2⁢𝐻−𝑇⁢𝑋2 compounds are reduced to about 1 eV.},

Our approach is based on the multiband semiconductor Bloch equations in length gauge, which are formulated in the basis of eigenfunctions of a 14-band 𝐤·𝐩 model. Excitonic effects are included by treating the Coulomb interaction on the level of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation and, furthermore, carrier longitudinal-optical and carrier longitudinal-acoustic phonon-scattering processes are included on the second-order Born-Markov level. The random 𝑘-dependent phase factors that originate from the numerical diagonalization of the eigenstates are treated by implementing a smooth gauge transformation. The flexible numerically implemented gauging procedure allows us to include many-body effects when integrating the semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results demonstrate that anomalous currents appear after resonant optical excitation of excitonic resonances. These currents are even stronger than those obtained when neglecting excitonic effects and exciting above the band gap. In the excitonic anomalous current transients, we identify temporal oscillations which can be attributed to the dynamics of excitonic wave packets since their frequency corresponds to the separation of the 1⁢𝑠 and 2⁢𝑠 exciton resonances. The numerical results are in very good agreement with experiments.},

By solving the SBE, we obtain both shift and ballistic currents. For a particular excitation geometry, we obtain a ballistic current which is absent if the electron-hole attraction is neglected. Whereas in other cases excitonic effects quantitatively modify photocurrents that originate from single-particle properties, here we demonstrate the existence of a ballistic current which is absent in single-particle calculations. This photocurrent is of second order in the light-matter interaction and is purely caused by the asymmetric electron-hole Coulomb attraction that results from the inversion asymmetry of GaAs. Furthermore, we show that the coherent dynamics of excitonic wave packets gives rise to oscillations in the photocurrent transients.},

Combining it with photoluminescence studies, we deduce an exciton binding energy of 0.22 ± 0.1 eV (or 0.42 eV if the second threshold is use), a value that is lower than current theoretical predictions. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we directly observe metallic edge states of single layer MoS2. In the bulk region of MoS2, the Fermi level is located at 1.8 eV above the valence band maximum, possibly due to the formation of a graphite/MoS2 heterojunction. At the edge, however, we observe an upward band bending of 0.6 eV within a short depletion length of about 5 nm, analogous to the phenomena of Fermi level pinning of a 3D semiconductor by metallic surface states.},

Full out-of-plane spin polarization is due to the two-dimensional nature of the electron motion and the potential gradient asymmetry. By suppression of the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation, spin lifetimes are expected to be very long.

The projected density of states (PDOS) of a single monolayer is calculated and compared to that of bulk MoS2. The effective masses and the orbital character of the band edges at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone are determined. The spin-splittings of the conduction band minimum (CBMIN) and valence band maximum (VBMAX) are calculated over the whole Brillouin zone. It is found that the maximum spin-splitting of VBMAX is attained at the K point of the Brillouin zone and is responsible for the experimentally observed splitting between the A1 and B1 excitons.},

It is found that the properties related to the Dirac cone do not appear in the case of two-dimensional hexagonal germanium, which is metallic, contrary to two-dimensional hexagonal silicon, also known as silicene, which has an electronic structure very similar to the one of graphene, making them possibly equivalent.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that single-layer transition-metal oxides and dichalcogenides (MX2) might offer properties superior to those of graphene. So far, only very few MX2 compounds have been synthesized as suspended single layers, and some of them have been exfoliated as thin sheets. Using first-principles structure optimization and phonon calculations based on density functional theory, we predict that, out of 88 different combinations of MX2 compounds, several of them can be stable in free-standing, single-layer honeycomb-like structures. These materials have two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and have top-view appearances as if they consisted of either honeycombs or centered honeycombs. However, their bonding is different from that of graphene; they can be viewed as a positively charged plane of transition-metal atoms sandwiched between two planes of negatively charged oxygen or chalcogen atoms. Electron correlation in transition-metal oxides was treated by including Coulomb repulsion through LDA + U calculations. Our analysis of stability was extended to include in-plane stiffness, as well as ab initio, finite-temperature molecular dynamics calculations. Some of these single-layer structures are direct- or indirect-band-gap semiconductors, only one compound is half-metal, and the rest are either ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic metals. Because of their surface polarity, band gap, high in-plane stiffness, and suitability for functionalization by adatoms or vacancies, these single-layer structures can be utilized in a wide range of technological applications, especially as nanoscale coatings for surfaces contributing crucial functionalities. In particular, the manifold WX2 heralds exceptional properties promising future nanoscale applications.},

Among the family of transition-metal dichalcogenide structures, the one-dimensional nanotube is particularly attractive because it produces a spontaneous photocurrent that is prohibited in its higher-dimensional counterparts. Here, we show that WS2 nanotubes exhibit a giant shift current near the infrared region, amounting to four times the previously reported values in the higher frequency range. The wall-to-wall charge shift constitutes a key advantage of the one-dimensional nanotube geometry, and we consider a Janus-type heteroatomic configuration that can maximize this interwall effect. To assess the nonlinear effect of a strong field and the nonadiabatic effect of atomic motion, we carried out direct real-time integration of the photoinduced current using time-dependent density functional theory. Our findings provide a solid basis for a complete quantum mechanical understanding of the unique light–matter interaction hidden in the geometric characteristics of the reduced dimension.},

	abstract = {The photovoltaic effect in traditional p–n junctions—where a p-type material (with an excess of holes) abuts an n-type material (with an excess of electrons)—involves the light-induced creation of electron–hole pairs and their subsequent separation, generating a current. This photovoltaic effect is particularly important for environmentally benign energy harvesting, and its efficiency has been increased dramatically, almost reaching the theoretical limit1. Further progress is anticipated by making use of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)2, which does not require a junction and occurs only in crystals with broken inversion symmetry3. However, the practical implementation of the BPVE is hampered by its low efficiency in existing materials4–10. Semiconductors with reduced dimensionality2 or a smaller bandgap4,5 have been suggested to be more efficient. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are exemplary small-bandgap, two-dimensional semiconductors11,12 in which various effects have been observed by breaking the inversion symmetry inherent in their bulk crystals13–15, but the BPVE has not been investigated. Here we report the discovery of the BPVE in devices based on tungsten disulfide, a member of the TMD family. We find that systematically reducing the crystal symmetry beyond mere broken inversion symmetry—moving from a two-dimensional monolayer to a nanotube with polar properties—greatly enhances the BPVE. The photocurrent density thus generated is orders of magnitude larger than that of other BPVE materials. Our findings highlight not only the potential of TMD-based nanomaterials, but also more generally the importance of crystal symmetry reduction in enhancing the efficiency of converting solar to electric power.},

	abstract = {Stacking order in van der Waals materials determines the coupling between atomic layers and is therefore the key to materials’ properties. Recently, ferroelectricity, a phenomenon exhibiting reversible spontaneous electrical polarization, has been observed in zero-degree aligned van der Waals structures. In these artificial stacks, the single-domain size is limited by angle misalignment. Here we show that naturally rhombohedrally stacked MoS2 can host a homogeneous spontaneous polarization throughout the exfoliated flakes, free of misalignment. Utilizing this homogeneous polarization and its induced depolarization field, we build a graphene–MoS2-based photovoltaic device with high efficiency. Few-layer MoS2 is thinner than most oxide-based ferroelectric films, which allows us to maximize the depolarization field and study its impact at the atomically thin limit, whereas the highly uniform polarization in the commensurate crystal enables a tangible path for upscaling. The external quantum efficiency of our device is up to 16\% at room temperature, over one order larger than the highest efficiency observed in bulk photovoltaic devices, owing to the reduced screening in graphene, exciton-enhanced light–matter interaction and ultrafast interlayer relaxation. Our findings make rhombohedral transition metal dichalcogenides a promising candidate for applications such as energy-efficient photodetection with high speed and programmable polarity.},
