    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent studies have revealed that single-layer transition-metal oxides and
  dichalcogenides (MX2) might offer properties superior to those of graphene.
  So far, only very few MX2 compounds have been synthesized as suspended single
  layers, and some of them have been exfoliated as thin sheets. Using
  first-principles structure optimization and phonon calculations based on
  density functional theory, we predict that, out of 88 different combinations
  of MX2 compounds, several of them can be stable in free-standing,
  single-layer honeycomb-like structures. These materials have two-dimensional
  hexagonal lattices and have top-view appearances as if they consisted of
  either honeycombs or centered honeycombs. However, their bonding is different
  from that of graphene; they can be viewed as a positively charged plane of
  transition-metal atoms sandwiched between two planes of negatively charged
  oxygen or chalcogen atoms. Electron correlation in transition-metal oxides
  was treated by including Coulomb repulsion through LDA + U calculations. Our
  analysis of stability was extended to include in-plane stiffness, as well as
  ab initio, finite-temperature molecular dynamics calculations. Some of these
  single-layer structures are direct- or indirect-band-gap semiconductors, only
  one compound is half-metal, and the rest are either ferromagnetic or
  nonmagnetic metals. Because of their surface polarity, band gap, high
  in-plane stiffness, and suitability for functionalization by adatoms or
  vacancies, these single-layer structures can be utilized in a wide range of
  technological applications, especially as nanoscale coatings for surfaces
  contributing crucial functionalities. In particular, the manifold WX2 heralds
  exceptional properties promising future nanoscale applications.%

    This invaluable textbook presents the basic elements needed to understand
  and research into semiconductor physics. It deals with elementary excitations
  in bulk and low-dimensional semiconductors, including quantum wells, quantum
  wires and quantum dots. The basic principles underlying optical
  nonlinearities are developed, including excitonic and many-body plasma
  effects. Fundamentals of optical bistability, semiconductor lasers,
  femtosecond excitation, the optical Stark effect, the semiconductor photon
  echo, magneto-optic effects, as well as bulk and quantum-confined
  Franz-Keldysh effects, are covered. The material is presented in sufficient
  detail for graduate students and researchers with a general background in
  quantum mechanics.This fifth edition includes an additional chapter on
  'Quantum Optical Effects' where the theory of quantum optical effects in
  semiconductors is detailed. Besides deriving the 'semiconductor luminescence
  equations' and the expression for the stationary luminescence spectrum,
  results are presented to show the importance of Coulombic effects on the
  semiconductor luminescence and to elucidate the role of excitonic
  populations.%

    Two-dimensional group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides have
  extraordinary properties originating from their complex electronic
  structures. , Atomically thin group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides
  (TMDs) have recently emerged as a new class of two-dimensional (2D)
  semiconductors with extraordinary properties including the direct band gap in
  the visible frequency range, the pronounced spinâ€“orbit coupling, the
  ultra-strong Coulomb interaction, and the rich physics associated with the
  valley degree of freedom. These 2D TMDs exhibit great potential for device
  applications and have attracted vast interest for the exploration of new
  physics. 2D TMDs have complex electronic structures which underlie their
  physical properties. Here we review the bulk electronic structures of these
  new 2D materials as well as the theoretical models developed at different
  levels, along which we sort out the understanding of the origins of a variety
  of properties observed or predicted.%

    We present a three-band tight-binding (TB) model for describing the
  low-energy physics in monolayers of group-VIB transition metal
  dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se, Te). As the conduction- and
  valence-band edges are predominantly contributed by the dz2, dxy, and
  dx2âˆ’y2 orbitals of M atoms, the TB model is constructed using these three
  orbitals based on the symmetries of the monolayers. Parameters of the TB
  model are fitted from the first-principles energy bands for all MX2
  monolayers. The TB model involving only the nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings is
  sufficient to capture the band-edge properties in the Â±K valleys, including
  the energy dispersions as well as the Berry curvatures. The TB model
  involving up to the third-nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings can well reproduce
  the energy bands in the entire Brillouin zone. Spin-orbit coupling in valence
  bands is well accounted for by including the on-site spin-orbit interactions
  of M atoms. The conduction band also exhibits a small valley-dependent spin
  splitting which has an overall sign difference between MoX2 and WX2. We
  discuss the origins of these corrections to the three-band model. The
  three-band TB model developed here is efficient to account for low-energy
  physics in MX2 monolayers, and its simplicity can be particularly useful in
  the study of many-body physics and physics of edge states.%

    Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation
  nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is
  relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely
  studied two-dimensional material is graphene1,2, both because of its rich
  physics3,4,5 and its high mobility6. However, pristine graphene does not have
  a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including
  transistors7. Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity
  and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon
  films8,9,10,11,12,13 or requires high voltages14,15. Although single layers
  of MoS2 have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8Â eV (ref.Â 16), previously
  reported mobilities in the 0.5â€“3Â cm2Â Vâˆ’1Â sâˆ’1 range17 are too low for
  practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to
  demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS2 mobility of at least
  200Â cm2Â Vâˆ’1Â sâˆ’1, similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and
  demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of
  1Â Ã—Â 108 and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS2 has
  a direct bandgap16,18, it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs19,
  which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer
  MoS2 could also complement graphene in applications that require thin
  transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.%

    We measure the optical-absorption spectra and optical conductivities of
  excitons and trions in monolayers of metal dichalcogenide MoS2 and compare

  model for excitons with modifications to account for small exciton radii and
  large exciton relative wave function spread in momentum space, phase space
  blocking due to Pauli exclusion in doped materials, and wave-vector-dependent
  dielectric constant gives results that agree well with experiments. The
  measured exciton optical-absorption spectra are used to obtain experimental
  estimates for the exciton radii that fall in the 7â€“10Ã… range and agree
  well with theory. The measured trion optical-absorption spectra are used to
  obtain values for the trion radii that also agree well with theory. The
  measured values of the exciton and trion radii correspond to binding energies
  that are in good agreement with values obtained from first-principles
