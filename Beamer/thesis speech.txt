Good day, teachers and fellow student. Now is my turn to present my work, on the "Calculation of the linear absorption spectrum of MoS2". First, let go through the overview of this presentation. I will go through Overview of the compound, its properties and why we choose this path:
Transition metal dichalcogenides, which will be preferred as TMD from now, are compound of the type MX2. Its monolayer structure have the form of a sandwich, with above and below layer are layer of chalcogenides, the medium layer is transition metal layer. Its first Brillouin zone, will be preferred as BZ from now, has the hexagon shape. TMD have the layers structure, therefore we can easily make monolayer of it like extract the lego structure.
The monolayer of TMD have some interesting properties, such as: "Stable in the air at the room temperature", direct band-gap in the visible light range, "no center of inversion" and strong spin-orbit coupling. These properties of TMD promise it will become a gift material in electronic and opto-electronic. For ex: making solar cells with aiming to surpass the Schockley-Queisser limit.
In this work, we choose to calculate the linear absorption spectrum to obtain the exciton binding energy. Since TMD is a low-dimensional material, results in the huge exciton binding energy (two magnitude orders in compared with other bulk semiconductor). Early theory predict binding energy too large in compare with experiment, so we need to calculate it to match with the experiment. To calculate, we need to choose a model that fit in the entire BZ. In this work, we choose a tight-binding model, which fit in the entire BZ.
The tight-binding wave function have the form of Eq. (1), we include it into the time-independence Schroedinger, multiply and take integral over r to get Eq. (2) in which include Eq. (3). The model we using in this work is called three-band tight-binding models, Its using basic function of 3 d-type orbitals as shown.
